Have you ever highlighted something in vim, yanked it, and then realized you
wanted to yank it to a different buffer, often + or \*? Well, try the command
**gv**. It will highlight whatever you had previously selected. I probably use
it at least once a day.

Enjoy!

If you'd like to learn more, I can recommend two excellent books.  I first
learned how to use vi from
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/059652983X/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=059652983X&linkCode=as2&tag=afoolishmanif-20&linkId=1d3b90d608a023a1dcb898b903b6f6ac">Learning the vi and Vim Editors</a><img src="//ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=afoolishmanif-20&l=am2&o=1&a=059652983X" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />.
The new edition has a lot more information and spends more time on Vim specific
features.  It was helpful for me at the time, and the fundamental model of vi is
still well supported in Vim and this book explores that well.

Second, if you really want to up your editing game, check out
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1680501275/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1680501275&linkCode=as2&tag=afoolishmanif-20&linkId=4518880cd2a7fd1333456edcbacc26f6">Practical Vim</a><img src="//ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=afoolishmanif-20&l=am2&o=1&a=1680501275" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />.
It's a very approachable book that unpacks some of the lesser used features in
ways that will be clearly and immediately useful.  I periodically review this
book because it's such a treasure trove of clear hints and tips.
