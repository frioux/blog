Normally I opt to eschew metablog post (how meta is that?!) but I figured this deserves a brief explanation.

I have been getting more and more spam lately. Fortunately Akismet usually keeps humans from seeing it, but Akismet has also kept back plenty of spam too. So I decided to go with the more powerful reCAPTCHA for comments from now on. I know it's a hassle, but it could be worse. There are lots of bad CAPTCHA plugins out there and in general I like the reCAPTCHA concept. Anyway, sorry!
