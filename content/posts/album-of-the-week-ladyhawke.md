Sorry I've neglected the Album of the Week. It's really hard to write about music. I think I am going to make my requirements for AOTW postage less strict.

So with that in mind, this weeks Album of the Week is the eponymous [Ladyhawke](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001FBPS3C?ie=UTF8&tag=afooman-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B001FBPS3C)![](http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=afooman-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B001FBPS3C) . It's a very 80's sounding album by the interesting artist Ladyhawke. According to Wikipedia Ladyhawke has a weird seagull disease, Asbergers syndrome, and is allergic to medicine?

I love the songs Paris is Burning, and Dusk 'Til Dawn. If you can get ahold of the international version of Paris is Burning where she sings english for most of the song and French for the chorus that is most excellent. I haven't been able to find it though.

Colors: Black and Hot Pink.
