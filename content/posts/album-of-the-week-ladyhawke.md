Sorry I've neglected the Album of the Week. It's really hard to write about
music. I think I am going to make my requirements for AOTW postage less strict.

So with that in mind, this weeks Album of the Week is the eponymous

It's a very 80's sounding album by the interesting artist Ladyhawke. According
to Wikipedia Ladyhawke has a weird seagull disease, Asbergers syndrome, and is
allergic to medicine?

I love the songs Paris is Burning, and Dusk 'Til Dawn. If you can get ahold of
the international version of Paris is Burning where she sings english for most
of the song and French for the chorus that is most excellent. I haven't been
able to find it though.

Colors: Black and Hot Pink.
