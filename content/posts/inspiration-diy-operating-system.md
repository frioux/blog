[Last Friday I blogged about some things that inspire
me](/posts/miscellaneous-inspiration/) and mentioned a missing link; how to
build your own operating system from scratch.  I found it!

[xv6](https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2016/xv6.html) is a Unix-like operating
system built for teaching.  [The full source is available on
Github](https://github.com/mit-pdos/xv6-public) and [there is a free, brief,
book that goes with
it](https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2016/xv6/book-rev9.pdf).  I want to work
through this, as my Operating Systems class in college was *way* less detailed
than this.

Enjoy and have a great week!
