I recently purchased an Avatar to be created by Scott Meyer of [Basic Instructions](http://basicinstructions.net). Today he sent me the completed avatar. Here it is: ![This is me!](/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/frew-schmidt-1000-300x300.png "fREW Schmidt")

Pretty sweet, huh? Anyway, I figured this would be cool, because I get to look cool **and** support an excellent webcomic/artist.

Get your own [here](http://basicinstructions.net/?page_id=540)!

Oh yeah, and maybe you want to see [the original](http://www.flickr.com/photos/simcah/258269209/). That was done by my roommate at the time.
