I just got back from [this year's YAPC::NA](http://www.yapcna.org/yn2014/)
and boy did I have a good time!

I'm trying to just get it down before I get back into the groove of
regular life, so don't expect poetry (like those of us who where in [rjbs'
talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG425RMEkRo) were treated to during
technical difficulties.)

First off, this year I took [Rik's advice from his !!con
blog](http://rjbs.manxome.org/rubric/entry/2049) and decided to just walk
up to random people and talk to them.  In the past I've tried to hang out
mostly with the same people.  While that's fine and those people are cool,
I really got to hang out with a lot of cool new people, like mcsnolte,
fitzelliot, vanstyn, silverdirk, and more who I forgot the name of.  I also
had a really good evening with rjbs and particle, which was a great last
hurrah that included singing the Duck Tales theme song.

In addition to a great hallway track, logistics this year were *awesome*!
There were paid staff to ensure that the live streaming of the videos
went well (my boss even watched one of my talks live!)  There were
a handful of technical people who were helpful with the inevitable
technical difficulties (thanks again hobbs!)  They even got a [Hugo award
winning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Stross#Awards) [CPAN
author](https://metacpan.org/author/CHSTROSS) to [speak at one of the
keynotes!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EPQLKTcJ26s)

And as usual there is a pile of software I need to try out / stress test /
write automated tests for.  I'm super excited to run my services correctly with
[silverdirk's daemonproxy](https://github.com/silverdirk/daemonproxy).  I'm
planning on using [vanstyn's RapidApp](https://github.com/vanstyn/RapidApp/)
at work with more than one project and [Dockerizing
it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uyE-SUUMgU8) and *maybe* writing a
Win32 Installer so people have no excuse not to use it (and in the process
following [Sawyer's advice](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjOQZf0Ad74)
because no one cares about system Perl with a cool enough App.)  I'm planning
on writing a new personal IRC bot thanks to [rjbs' final 1.21 Gigawatts
talk](http://youtu.be/IG425RMEkRo?t=47m7s).  And the last thing (that I can
remember!) is that I've committed to helping Tim Bunce release a cool web
module by fleshing out the tests.

Finally, there were some wildcards I never would have expected.  silverdirk
has a DeLorean.  He has Perl running parts of the instrument cluster (not
totally complete but nearly.)  He has a picture with him, his lady-friend, and
Christopher Lloyd.  Awesome.  Also, somehow I missed that Father Chrysostomos
is literally a monk who often works on the Perl core.  He's a *real* perl monk!

I did [two](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hUD1RMsYrjM)
[talks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CwaObbSK88) this
year and felt like they went much better than expected.
I had a *huge* turnout for the (as I thought) relatively niche
[DBIx::Introspector](https://metacpan.org/pod/DBIx::Introspector), but I am
clearly wrong and it solves a problem a lot of people have.  Additionally,
the [DBIx::Class](https://metacpan.org/pod/DBIx::Class) talk I did seemed to
clarify a lot for the people I spoke with afterwards, though I still think
it needs work.  I'm starting to think it needs to be a class instead of a talk.

I am already excited for next year!
