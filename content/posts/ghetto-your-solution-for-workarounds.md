I like to make playlists. But I also reorganize my music something like once or twice a year. Because of that my playlists get broken as they are really just lists of filenames. This past summer I wrote some code in ruby that would find files with the same basename but ignore the directory structure, and reconstruct playlists from that. It worked perfectly **except** every now and then I would get a live version or two. This works because I have an sqlite database of all of my music thanks to amaroK.

Well, I decided that I would update the script so that I wouldn't have those issues with live versions. I decided that I would have an intermediate filetype, which I would basically keep around forever. Announcing the FRU media playlist filetype! Actually not that exciting. Anyway, here are a couple scripts:

m3u2fru.pl6:

fru2m3u.pl6:

But the more important part, is the Ghetto module. Currently rakudo does not have any way to get the output of a command, but it can read from files, so we can fake it:

Obviously this is slow, bad in that it could possibly overwrite files, etc. It's ghetto. But the idea is that later when we actually **can** do something like this without a ghetto solution it won't be hard to fix your code.

I also thought it was fun to do a pipe-based solution. The way I had it set up before was something like this:

    ./plup.rb old.m3u new.m3u

That's alright, but I would usually look at the output to make sure it was right. Now I do this:

    cat old.m3u | ./m3u2fru.pl6 | ./fru2m3u.pl6 > new.m3u

Sure it's longer, but I can easily see the output at any point in the process. Furthermore, since I am using zsh (maybe bash can do this too, not sure) I can do this:

    cat old.m3u | ./m3u2fru.pl6 >new.fru | ./fru2m3u.pl6 > new.m3u

So I can keep the intermediate results for next time!
