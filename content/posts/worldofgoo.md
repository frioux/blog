I just completed [World of
Goo](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001ENOVP2?ie=UTF8&tag=afooman-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B001ENOVP2)![](http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=afooman-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B001ENOVP2)
(or buy direct, [here](http://www.2dboy.com/games.php)). Very fun game!

I like video games, but I tend to not play them very much because I do all kinds
of other things (lots of programming if you can't tell :-) ) but recently I've
found that they help me clear my mind when I am trying to figure stuff out.
Like, I'll be coding and I will usually get stuck on a design issue. It's rarely
a question of how to get it done, but more, what's the best way to get it done.
I certainly don't always choose the right answer, but I try to go back and
correct wrong answers as soon and as often as possible.

Furthermore, I really appreciate these indie games. They have something in
common with what I call art (a post for another day.) Here's an interesting
factoid: World of Goo was made by four people. Only two of which were coders!
That blows me away.

Anyway, the game was great; it installed and ran without a hitch on Ubuntu; so
try out the demo, and if you dig it, purchase it.
