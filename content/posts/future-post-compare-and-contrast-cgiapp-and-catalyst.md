So I'd like to do a post on CGIApp and Catalyst. People on IRC keep telling me that using CGIApp is wrong (mostly because they've never used it) and that I should switch to Catalyst.

Catalyst may be great, but I haven't seen any solid posts about how Catalyst is great. So help me out. Ignoring the fact that Catalyst is what everyone uses (so there are lots of plugins for it) what makes it so good?
