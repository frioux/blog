![Seeing in the Dark](/wp-content/uploads/2007/08/seeinginthedark.png)

Today the power was out from 9:30 am to 5:30 pm and I figured that it would be quite opportune to see if my latent super power was seeing in the dark.  I agree that that would be a pretty boring super power, but who ever said it had to be awesome?  Anyway, I took a shower for about half and hour in the pitch dark since the power was out and I never saw anything but my watch hands.  I am can safely rule out seeing in the dark.

Stay tuned and we'll find it yet!
