![Transform to Cat](/wp-content/uploads/2007/10/transformtocat2.png)

Today I tried to morph into a cat. No luck! I think I need one of those cubes
that they had in the Animorphs... If that were the case I would also need a cat.
And a friend named Ax maybe? Who knows?! Not me!

Now I have to leave to go to the dentist. What a bummer right? I think it's
because of all the acid that I had when I was in Honduras. See you space
cowboy...
