![Creating and/or Controlling Fire](/wp-content/uploads/2007/08/fire.png)

Still no super power.  Today I tried to make a match light without striking it.  I told it to light, it snapped my fingers at it, I tried using my mind.  All to no avail; it would not light.  So I lit it and tried to control the flame.  I had to light four matches in the hopes that one would stay lit long enough to for me to make the flame do anything but go out.  Sadly, this is not my super power.  Such is life right?

Tomorrow I am flying home from Honduras, so there may or may not be an update.  I don't want to be on the plane and test my super power and find it.  That would be sure to get me into trouble.  I'll try nonetheless, but no promises.
