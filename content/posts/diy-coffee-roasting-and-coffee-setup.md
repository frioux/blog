Lately I have been roasting my own coffee.  I am certainly not the first person
to do this nor even document it, but I tend to use my own blog as reference, so
here we go!

## Why?

I like good coffee.  My tastes have slowly gotten more and more refined and
recently I found myself spending top dollar for beans.  I am sortav a cheapskate
and generally try to reduce recurring costs.  After the initial investment into
equipment, coffee can actually be really cheap.  Typical good beans cost from
$10 to $20 a pound.  [Green beans are about $5 a
pound.](https://www.sweetmarias.com/category/green-coffee)

On top of that, if you buy from a small roaster, they may decide to stop
roasting some kind of beans just to "mix it up."  I love East African beans,
especially Ethiopian beans, and those were suddenly unavailable from my favorite
roasters.

Finally, when you roast your own beans, you can get coffee from all over the
world, for a consistent price, and you're able to roast it suit your preference.

## Bread Maker Roasting

Roasting with a bread maker is easy!  The short version is that you use the
bread maker to stir the beans while you hold a heat gun over the beans.  The
whole process takes from 12 to 15 minutes, in my experience.  Here are some good
links about coffee roasting:

 * [Bread Machine/Heat Gun Roasting FAQ](http://coffeecrone.com/roasting/faq.htm)
 * [Using Sight to Determine Degree of Roast](http://legacy.sweetmarias.com/library/content/using-sight-determine-degree-roast)
 * [Use All Five Senses To Determine Degree of Roast](http://legacy.sweetmarias.com/library/node/2926)

That first link was my reference when I got started.  The quality of your heat
gun, electricty, etc will determine how quickly the beans brown.  I have never
been able to get to the end of the first crack in less than ten to twelve
minutes, even though the Sweet Maria's folks seem to be able to pull that off.

Roasting coffee is pretty smelly and smokey.  It's surprising, because it
doesn't smell like coffee!  I actually dislike the smell of roasting coffee, but
I do know one person who enjoys it.  Unless you have amazingly good ventilation
in your kitchen, you should probably roast outside.  I had to buy

In case you've never done it before, first crack sounds like the crackling of
sticks in a fire.  When the bread maker is stirring the beans there is a bit of
clicking which I initially thought was first crack.  I suspect it sounds similar
to the sound of stirring marbles.  I would recommend waiting till the end of
first crack till you are confident enough to experiment.

I got <a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003GXM0EM/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B003GXM0EM&linkCode=as2&tag=afoolishmanif-20&linkId=98d7f1b4441e0991f75e639003ab2530">this breadmaker</a><img src="//ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=afoolishmanif-20&l=am2&o=1&a=B003GXM0EM" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /> but it's kindav a hassle and I may replace it with
<a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00067REBU/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B00067REBU&linkCode=as2&tag=afoolishmanif-20&linkId=f6b57ae3ca364ce3092c444d4c6eef28">this one</a><img src="//ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=afoolishmanif-20&l=am2&o=1&a=B00067REBU" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />.  If you can, just get a bread maker at your local thrift store,
check that it has a constant stir mode (often called "knead" or "dough") that
goes for at least 15 minutes.  Mine does a five minute stir then rests for a full minute, which
is pretty problematic, so I end up turning it off and on every five minutes.

I use <a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0053U2B8G/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B0053U2B8G&linkCode=as2&tag=afoolishmanif-20&linkId=c1741c786600967d8e31c50a7cdb08a2">this heatgun</a><img src="//ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=afoolishmanif-20&l=am2&o=1&a=B0053U2B8G" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />
and as far as I know it's perfect.  Simple to use and works.  Basically I put it
on high power (two lines, about 1000°F) and hold it about an inch from the beans
until first crack starts (typically about eight to ten minutes.)  During the
crack I either drop it down to low power (one line, about 500°F) or pull it back
from the beans to slow down the heating.  I definitely do not have it down to a
science, but people like my coffee!

After you decide the beans are roasted to your preference, you need to cool them
down.  I put the beans in a metal colander, point a box fan at them, and stir
then with a wooden spoon.  I am likely to refine this step next as it doesn't
work great and is a hassle.  I might try the dual colander method where you
simply pour the beans through the air to cool them down from one colander to the
next.  Generally this step is simple if you don't go into second crack.

I personally measure the "roastedness" entirely by eye, with my clock as a
backup.  If the beans look light brown but it's been more than fifteen minutes,
I assume that my eye has been compromised somehow and that the beans are plenty
roasted.

## Day-to-Day Coffee Setup

Living with two small children leaves me with very little time to do things like
make coffee, breakfast, etc.  I can carve out half an hour once a week to roast
the beans, but making coffee every morning is hard.  What I do instead is use
the
<a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0006H0JVW/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B0006H0JVW&linkCode=as2&tag=afoolishmanif-20&linkId=11affb7362568508c2e067b00321f687">Toddy Cold Brew System</a><img src="//ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=afoolishmanif-20&l=am2&o=1&a=B0006H0JVW" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />
to make a coffee concentrate once a week.  The Toddy comes with instructions,
but basically it's seven cups of water in the coarsely ground coffee for 12 to
24 hours, and then when you drink it you add equal parts water to the coffee
concentrate.  So when I get up to go to work in the morning I combine about
a cup of coffee; the same amount of water; a large ice cube, shake, and go.

Note that I grind my coffee beans at work because we have a nice electric
grinder there, but I have notes below for how you might extend my travel hand
grinder to work for a whole pound.

## Travel Setup

When I travel I hate to feel like I'm imposing, but I also dislike getting
coffee that is just passable but still expensive at Starbucks.  The current
setup is as follows:

An <a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0018RY8H0/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B0018RY8H0&linkCode=as2&tag=afoolishmanif-20&linkId=ffc6d48a61bf922cb4775d20b00cb4ee">AeroPress</a><img src="//ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=afoolishmanif-20&l=am2&o=1&a=B0018RY8H0" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />
as a super portable coffee maker.  It's definitely a different kind of coffee
compared to the cold brew, but I like it, it travels well, and it's fast.

I have a hand grinder, specifically the
<a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004YIBVZM/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B004YIBVZM&linkCode=as2&tag=afoolishmanif-20&linkId=af028180c7d67a0a226545ba4d6582c2">Zassenhaus Panama</a><img src="//ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=afoolishmanif-20&l=am2&o=1&a=B004YIBVZM" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />
which is great because it fits inside of the AeroPress, grinds just as much as I
could need while travelling, and is an *excellent* grinder with a well mounted
burr.  The grinder is a beautiful piece of engineering and feels great to use.
The handle can be screwed off to fit well while packed.

I have a theory that if you wanted to grind more than it can fit (just about 20
grams, or a large cup of coffee) you could use a funnel for the beans and an
electric drill with flexible extension.  I haven't measured the actual bit that
goes into the grinder, but I'm picturing

Hopefully this motivates you if you have been considering making the jump to
home roasting.  Or maybe you had never considered that it is an easy option.
Either way, good luck and feel free to reach out if you want advice!

All this stuff about coffee makes me want to make a cup.
