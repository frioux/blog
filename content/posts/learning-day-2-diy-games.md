Today I did my second Learning Day; the subject was DIY Games.

<!--more-->

My intention for today's Learning Day was to read the first 100 pages of [Making
8-bit Arcade Games in C]().  I was too worn out by 1pm (thanks to two small
children) to start reading anything so that didn't happen; I still intend to
read it at some point though.

Instead, I started watching [Pico-8 Hero -
Breakout](https://www.lexaloffle.com/bbs/?tid=28030), a long series of videos
where one guy builds up a game (breakout) bit by bit.  It's a little basic for
me, and I might have skipped it or watched it at 1.75x speed normally, but as I
said I was just too tired to be as productive as normal.

Even if you are a good programmer, the videos have some solid advice on how to
make games.  I intend to keep watching them, though I'm not sure when, to glean
what I can from them.
