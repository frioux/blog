Today I did my second Learning Day; the subject was DIY Games.

My intention for today's Learning Day was to read the first 100 pages of
<a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1545484759/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1545484759&linkCode=as2&tag=afoolishmanif-20&linkId=f7b6516e5b0d6a9e192112ea456fda97">Making 8-bit Arcade Games in C</a><img src="//ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=afoolishmanif-20&l=am2&o=1&a=1545484759" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />.
I was too worn out by 1pm (thanks to two small
children) to start reading anything so that didn't happen; I still intend to
read it at some point though.

Instead, I started watching [Pico-8 Hero -
Breakout](https://www.lexaloffle.com/bbs/?tid=28030), a long series of videos
where one guy builds up a game (breakout) bit by bit.  It's a little basic for
me, and I might have skipped it or watched it at 1.75x speed normally, but as I
said I was just too tired to be as productive as normal.

Even if you are a good programmer, the videos have some solid advice on how to
make games.  I intend to keep watching them, though I'm not sure when, to glean
what I can from them.
