I have some thoughts about personal time management.

<!--more-->

[For years](/posts/the-pomodoro-technique/) [I've
been](/posts/the-pomodoro-technique-three-years-later/) [trying
to](/posts/getting-things-done/) stay on top of managing my time.  This has been
of varying success, but for the most part I am pleased with the system (not to
say my adherence to it.)  I have recently noticed a few problems that I have to
address, one way or another.  I think these solutions are generic enough to
apply to basically everyone.

## Slack

Slack is a huge time and productivity sink.  It's great for when you need to
have some kind of remote meeting thing, but a constant water-cooler + ad hoc
meeting is not good.  [At my previous job](http://lynxguide.com/) I could just
close the door to my office and get stuff done.  Not so [at
ZR](https://web.archive.org/web/20190330183125/https://www.ziprecruiter.com/hiring/technology), where I neither have a door
nor would that be sufficient, due to the constant activity on Slack.

The first thing I want to point out about this is that Slack (like all human
interaction, I guess) is a system where response to a stimulus triggers another
response, basically forever.  The implication here is that someone asks
something on Slack, you answer the question quickly, and they respond with
another question, or whatever.  While this may be fine, it is often a time suck
that rewards people who don't read docs, emails, or whatever, so it can benefit
you to *at least* add latency to your responses.

So with that in mind, I have been getting in to work lately around 8 and **I
don't even open Slack till after my first meeting.**  It's been working
amazingly well; I am able to work on my personal tasks at a satisfying rate and
the world has not collapsed.  If I could totally mute Slack except for a few
channels temporarily that would be a better solution, but this is fine and maybe
better, since I don't have to pick the channels that are worth interrupting me
(hint: none are, you can page me.)

## Recency

There's this thing where someone mentions a task and my instinct is to do it
now, rather than add it to a pile.  The result is that small tasks get done and
long tasks end up languishing.  Some immediate tasks really should bypass any
form of system due to how quickly they can be done, rather than go through the
overhead of documenting the task, moving it around, etc.  But I think this
should be considered an exception, rather than a typical or default state.

Furthermore, my current notes system has a landing page where it shows my
"working set" as:

 * inbox
 * waiting
 * next steps

**This is totally backwards.**  I should be doing stuff from next steps, rather
than dispatching things out of my inbox, by default.  Waiting maybe shouldn't
even be front and center, as by definition someone else is handling those tasks.
With that in mind I intend to rearrange those a bit, maybe even by hiding the
inbox by default.

## Convenience

This one really kills me.  There are things I'd like to do with my time: read
more non-fiction, practice non-tech hobbies, etc.  I end up doing other stuff,
like reading twitter, that's just easier to do.  It's so much easier to pull out
my phone than it is to get a book off of a shelf.  I could (and maybe should)
just get ebook versions of the non-tech books in question (which I have no
qualms with) but I feel like I should spend more effort trying to categorically
fix this.  I already set a time limit on twitter to 30m a day, but that's just
one example.  I am going to try to reduce the burden of doing some of the
things I want to do and increase the burden of some of the things that are easy.
We'll see how it goes.

## Expertise

One interesting result I've noticed is that expertise in almost any topic is a
kind of curse; if you are good at something, you are probably going to do a lot
of it.  In part this is due to it being fun to be good at something, but it also
means you get dragged into doing that stuff.  This is vague and hard for me to
describe, but I feel like being great at something is both really fun and
interesting, and then in the quiet moments you can think about how it's an
albatross around your neck.

I'm not sure what to do about this, other than exercize constant vigilance that
the thing I'm doing is worth doing rather than just being fun.
