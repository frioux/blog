This week I...

1. paid of 25% of my college loans (!!!)
2. scheduled a pickup from goodwill for clothes to get rid of next week
3. went in to work on Saturday to get caught up on some stuff or our project
4. and planned a dinner for myself and friends for next week that I'll be cooking

A good start if I may say so myself.
