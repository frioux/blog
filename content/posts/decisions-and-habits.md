I'm building new habits to meet new goals.

<!--more-->

My friend [Rob](https://hoelz.ro/blog/) sent me a link to [Dan Luu's post about
writing](https://danluu.com/writing-non-advice/) and said, "dunno if you still
have an interest in blogging, but I'm like 40% through
[https://danluu.com/writing-non-advice/] and it's really good (like most of
Dan's stuff)"

What struck me was Rob's implicit, not-quite-accurate, but nonetheless incisive
instinct that I had intentionally set aside blogging.  At this point my most
recent post was posted over 6 months ago.  I intentionally do not have a schedule for
blog posts, but what Rob said got me thinking...

## A Hard Year

It's been a pretty difficult year for me.  I won't go into the details here; if
you want the play-by-play, ask me and I'll tell you, but probably not in
writing, at least not for a few years.  Abstractly I will say that the
hardest thing for me for the past year has been allowing myself to indulge in a
kind of negative thinking where I would vilify people for the decisions they
were making.

This not only meant I couldn't have productive conversations or learn from
these people, but more importantly it meant that my attitude was such that
almost anything I did felt pointless.  This inevitably came through when I'd be
interacting with other people, poisoning anything I'd touch.  On top of that,
it absolutely *killed* my motivation.

I have ADHD but it's pretty well managed from living with it productively for
decades.  But ADHD often means pushing hard to do basic tasks that are boring.
When it felt like those basic tasks were also worthless it meant that I was
basically paralyzed and ineffective at nearly everything.

At one point I had a stunning moment of clarity.  I realized I was choosing to
foster these feelings of resentment, these grudges.  I don't want to close my
eyes and assume other people are perfectly trustworthy, but there is a useful
middle ground between total distrust and absolute trust.  I want to point out
that this moment started with a conversation where I saw my own bizarre
perspective, and then seeing evidence of my perspective being wrong, and then a
lot of reflection.  It took a total of 3 weeks to fully untangle my thinking.

Since becoming more lucid to my own situation many things have improved.
Obviously my attitude and my productivity have gotten better.  My outlook on
the future has improved as well.  But I'm not at my destination yet.

## Bad Habits

Like basically all people, I am a creature of habit.  Since COVID-19 really hit
us (Friday the 13th in March of 2020 for me) I've accumulated plenty of habits
and neglected many others.  I remember that first Monday after lockdown
started; I couldn't bring myself to exercise.  What was the harm in letting
things slide a little bit while in the midst of a global pandemic?

Many of the productive habits I'd cultivated over years (writing, thoughtful
time management, exercise, joyful side projects) fell to the wayside.  Some
part of this was natural, though counterproductive, coping with a hard
situation.  But another part of it was a willful rebellion, a self-spite that
came from a place of anger, grudges, and bitter vitriol against other people.

I think that was the worst of it: getting into a habit of seeing other people
as antagonists.  Your perspective in life is basically a mental habit.  Getting
back into the habit of seeing the best in other people, and seeing them for who
they are (actual human beings who are valuable and worth knowing, interacting
with, etc) rather than the 2-D caricature that my selfish mind wants to turn
them into is work, but it's worth doing.

Part of how I couch this to myself is that seeing people as who they really are
is a productivity play; it's a means to getting back to the effective self that
I want to be.  But really, it's far more important to value people correctly
than it is to get stuff done.  If the side effect is productivity or happiness
that's great, but honestly my productivity will be long forgotten in some tens
of years anyway.

## Productive Habits

Here are some habits I've had that have been especially productive:

 * [releasing CPAN modules once a week for about four
   years](https://blog.afoolishmanifesto.com/posts/farewell-cpan-contest/)
 * [writing often, if not
   regularly](https://blog.afoolishmanifesto.com/posts/five-hundredth/)
 * daily time management (surprisingly not discussed)

These all produce real output.  The tricky fact is, every time I build a
productive habit, I eventually end up with a startling realization that
while I am producing something, that something may have little or no value,
or be unaligned with my ultimate goals.

In this manner habits are a kind of double edged sword.  Often habits can be
effective or productive, and they can definitely be bad, but it's rare that
they can be universally good.  For everything there's a season, and sometimes
you need to make good habits, and sometimes you need to get rid of those habits
and re-evaluate.

## Decisions

In the past I've come to the conclusion that it would be better to make
decisions before each action.  Habits disable your brain and that means making
progress on something that may not be worth doing.  The problem is, I don't
have the willpower to make decisions before each action.

If I want to do something, my best bet is to make a plan and then execute on
that plan, as a habit, for weeks, months, or years on end.

There was a time when my implicit goal was to make a name for myself in Open
Source; in my own small way I would say that was successful.  I have since
become disenchanted with much of the Open Source ecosystem, culture, and
motivations.  That's fine!  I have made an explicit decision not to invest in
Open Source as a matter of course and instead to spend my time on other
things.

Given all of the above, I want to consider habits that I need to stop, habits
that are working for me, goals I want to pick up, and habits that will help
with those goals.  I'm not going to publish all of that here.  I do want to
publicly say that I have two main goals:

 1. Publish and market at least two products for sale on Gumroad
 2. Spend a chunk of time each week iterating on those products or other, future products.

I admit that this is a strange turn for this discussion to take, but ultimately
I want to be more principled about what habits I build, and that means
considering my destination (or really a couple way-points on the path) first.

If you're interested in any of the above, [I have a product published on
Gumroad already](https://frew.gumroad.com/l/p8recon), but it's still much more
barebones than I'd rather.
