Some developers say to use [ExtUtils::MakeMaker](http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?ExtUtils::MakeMaker), some say to use [Module::Build](http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Module::Build). MB is supposed to supplant EU::MM, but people complain that it's too chatty. Thoughts? Hopes? Dreams? Inquiring minds want to know.
