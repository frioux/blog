So I hope this picture makes it obvious that I tried to control a balloon with my MIND.  Sadly I couldn't control it.  I tried from varying distances away, including extremely close; I tried such methods as imagining the balloon rising, willing the balloon to rise, making various had and finger gestures to get it to rise, and even telling it to rise.  If anyone has any awesome super power ideas for me to try let me know; I doubt I'll run out of ideas but it might be more fun to try yours.

Also: I am back in Freedom land and it's awesome.
