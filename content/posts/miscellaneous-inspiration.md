I thought it would be cool to share a list of things that are inspiring to me.
I haven't done much with any of these things, but I'd like to.

<!--more-->

 * [Capstone Engine](http://www.capstone-engine.org/): Disassembly framework
 * [Keystone Engine](http://www.keystone-engine.org/): Assembly framework
 * [Unicorn Engine](http://www.unicorn-engine.org/): Emulation framework

I have no idea what I'd use the above for, but they seem cool to me.  Bindings
exist in many high level languages.

[BIOS BITS](https://biosbits.org/) is a weird set of tools that let you tweak
your BIOS settings with Python before booting a traditional OS.  Again: no idea
what I could use this for but it seems pretty neat.

[Linux Insides](https://0xax.gitbooks.io/linux-insides/content/index.html) is a
book in progress about the internals of Linux.  I suspect it is more up to date
than some other similar works and the small amount I have read I have found
approachable and interesting.

[PoC||GTFO](https://www.alchemistowl.org/pocorgtfo/) is a beautifully crafted
zine.  Usually the PDFs are chimera in that they can be treated as zip files,
isos, android apps, and other weird formats.

Instrumentation beyond [strace](https://strace.io/) aka [Linux
Perf](http://brendangregg.com/linuxperf.html).  I use `strace` all the time; I'd
like to know how to use the lower-level options for when `strace` would be too
much of a performance hit or would not have the information available.

[ngrep](http://ngrep.sourceforge.net/) is sortav like a higher level
[tcpdump](http://www.tcpdump.org/).  I use tcpdump probably twice a year but
having seen a coworker use `ngrep` the way I use `strace` (often) I am inspired
to do the same.

[Hands on Game Programming](https://gumroad.com/l/hands-on-game-programming/)
came with a recent [Humble Bundle](http://humblebundle.com/); I had no idea I
was getting something so awesome.  This is the kind of programming book I love;
focused examples that let you grow with the industry.

In a similar vein, [I've written about Pico-8
before](https://blog.afoolishmanifesto.com/posts/pong/) but I am still enamored.
And at some point I may dive even deeper and try out
[LÃ–VE](https://love2d.org/), which is a framework for making 2D games in Lua.

Another inspiring "game thing" is the stupidly named (in the banal python
tradition and childish emulation tradition) [pyNES](https://gutomaia.net/pyNES/)
which lets you write games for the venerable Nintendo Entertainment System in
Python.

A long time ago I bought the [Create your own programming language
book](http://createyourproglang.com/).  I am not as excited about this as the
other things, because I know how much of a hassle it is, but I'd like to go
through it nonetheless.  As a side note, I had a link somewhere to a free book
that went through creating a fully bootable operating system, but I can't find
it, or it would be here.

Finally, despite having done less than a hundred lines of C professionally, I'd
still like to level up.  The free [Modern
C (pdf)](http://icube-icps.unistra.fr/img_auth.php/d/db/ModernC.pdf) book by
Jens Gustedt intrigues me and I'd like to read it.

Whew!  I hope you all enjoyed that!  I probably wouldn't have actually gone
through with writing this except that I was literally up late with a fever and
of course all my brain would do is think about this.  Have a great weekend and
do something inspiring!
