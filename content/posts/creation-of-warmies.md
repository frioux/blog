![Creation of Warmies](/wp-content/uploads/2007/08/warmies.png) Last night I tried to create enough "warmies," that is, energy in the form of heat, to be comfortably warm without any covers at all. It was a failure and I did not sleep very well. I also feel a little bad because the warmies I \*did\* create were just vanilla entropy, aka cosmic pollution. I hope that I did not contribute to a universal heat death.

In other news I am back at school and somewhat moved in. I just got conned out of 20 bucks and I am wishing that I were less trusting. If anyone else is in Longview drop me a line and we can awesome together.
