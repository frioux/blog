We are planning on using [DBIx::Class::Journal](http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?DBIx::Class::Journal) in a couple different projects of ours. Unfortunately DBICJ has foundered for more than a year as a dev release, and even that won't test correctly on win32. So I've done some work on it to get it in a more releasable state. I just released a developer release to CPAN and if you currently use DBICJ please test it out. Even if you don't use it at least test it so I can see if I get failures. The release should end up [here](http://search.cpan.org/~frew/DBIx-Class-Journal-0.900001_03/), but it will take a couple hours.
