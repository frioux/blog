This year at YAPC::NA nearly all the talks were filmed, including mine. I
watched them so I could glean a bit more ideas for how to make talks in the
future better.

Two things jumped out:

### I feel better now than I felt after doing the talks

This is great. I feel like they went really well now.

### The diversions into code weren't that great

On the other hand, actually showing the underlying code for DBICDH was probably
not worth the time spent.

And if you want to watch the videos, here they are:
