This is what I did in high school:

fREW => fROOH Represents Encephelon Welkin

fROOH => fRUE: Robotic Ominous Ossified Herald

fRUE => fRIOUX's Rectitude is Underpinned by Equivalence

fRIOUX => fiSMBoC RESEARCHes IMAGINATIVE ORGANIC UNIFICATIONS like XUOIRf

fiSMBoC => fREW is Station's Most Bodacious Creation

RESEARCH => Robots Eagerly Sailing Epic Artificial Rhythmic Cyclical Homonyms

IMAGINATIVE => Insane Mimicries of Amazingly Gorgeous, Incomplete Networks, Axiomatic Theorems, and Immortally Vivacious Ecstasy

ORGANIC => Original Renditions of Genetic Art Naturally Increasing in Complexity

UNIFICATIONS => Unions Normally Identified From Initial Characters; Aesthetically Tailored to Infer Other Notions Subconsciously
