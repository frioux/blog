![Controlling Fanblades](/wp-content/uploads/2007/08/controllingfanblades.png) Yeah, I know that it's not amazing, but it was the best I could come up with at the time. I tried the regular stuff, hand motions, verbal orders, imagination. No go. Also, it's not Catherine's super power either.

Sorry for the lapse in super power testing; I've been busy and whatnot. Hopefully it will get awesomer soon (that is, hopefully I'll find my super power.)
