brian d foy (author of [amazonify]0596527241::text::::numerous[/amazonify] [amazonify]0596102062::text::::perl[/amazonify] [amazonify]0596520107::text::::books[/amazonify]) asked this question on Stack Overflow: ["What are five things you hate about your favorite language?"](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/282329/what-are-five-things-you-hate-about-your-favorite-language)

I figured that since I am trying to bring perl 6 to fruition (note: I've only written tests, so I am not very good at helping so far) I would pick perl 6 as my favorite programming language. Here was my answer:

> I'm going out on a limb since I can't really use it full time, but I'll try anyway!
>
> Perl 6
>
> 1. func("frew") != func ("frew")
>   - It annoys me, but there is good reason for it. In perl 5 print (5 + 6) \* 10 still gets me every now and then)
> 2. It may be easier to parse than perl 5 in a lot of places, but it still kills my editor sometimes
> 3. It still has a lot of the line noise perl 5 which scares a lot of people. That means it's harder to get them excited etc.
> 4. There are no libraries yet.
>   - This will be a non issue if perl 6 does indeed end up supporting perl 5, but that may be a burden not worth bearing.
> 5. There's no REPL, or what rubyists would call irb.
>   - A solid interactive perl 6 with tab completion, color coding, etc, would make using and learning it so much nicer.
> 6. Currently the documentation is basically the English spec. Not exactly an easy read.
> 7. I know it's a stupid cliche, but it's not out yet!
>   - I am allowed to complain because I am helping :-P
>
> The first three are the language; the rest aren't really the language itself but the fact that it's not out yet.
