While I've been on paternity leave I have increased the amount of club soda that
I drink hugely.  This is mostly because I wanted to have a refreshing beverage
while in the non-air conditioned apartment.  I did a little research and found
out how to make my own so I could have as much as I wanted, and because Googling
for how to do it was hard, I figured I'd document it clearly here.

## What are we talking about here?

First off, soda: when I say soda I don't mean Coca Cola, I mean club soda,
though for most of this post I actually mean seltzer.  Seltzer is simply water
and carbon dioxide (CO₂.)  Seltzer is actually a little harsh, so people add
various salts (again, more on that later) to tone it down and taste more
neutral.  I really like club soda, but step one is to make seltzer.

## Why Build a Carbonator?

There are a few reasons.  One is cost.  I'll get into that more later, but at
some point, building your own rig is going to be cheaper than buying.  The
bigger reason for me is that it is easier to make soda than to buy it.  I live
in Santa Monica and walk to the grocery store, so adding heavy or large bottles
to my personal grocery cart is a drag.  Also it's always fun to make a thing
instead of buying it.

## Build it

First off, here is a bill of materials:

Total material cost: $121-$128

<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/frew/28915032500/in/dateposted-public/" title="All Parts"><img src="https://c5.staticflickr.com/9/8864/28915032500_f8c8623127_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="All Parts"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

You only need one regulator, but the dual one will let you know when your tank
is getting empty, so that might be nice to have.  On the other hand it makes the
full assembly much less compact, and I hear the other gauge tends to get broken
since it sticks out so much.

There is one other cost that is recurring, and that's the CO₂.  I got my CO₂ at
a homebrew supply store.  People say you can get it at a welding store.  I would
have expected that to be unsafe [but if Dave Arnold does it, it's probably
ok](https://twitter.com/CookingIssues/status/768601283112628224). At the
homebrew store 5lb of CO₂ was $20.  I saw all kinds of ranges for how far 5lb of
CO₂ would go, the low was about 30 gallons and the high was 155 gallons, so I'm
gonna use 100 gallons, or 378 liters.  I suspect water might be more soluble
than beer, which would imply that the CO₂ won't go as far, but I was unable to
find scientific studies backing up my belief (or more clearly they all used
different units and none of the ranges overlapped and I am not interested enough
to make a graph and extrapolate.)  Links to papers on the truth here are very
welcome.

### Assemble the Carbonator

Putting together the carbonator is pretty easy.  I took a bunch of pictures when
I did it, but I'd be surprised if anyone felt like they needed them.

Tools you need:

| Tool | Cost |
|------|------|
| <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000688ANU/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B000688ANU&linkCode=as2&tag=afoolishmanif-20&linkId=7f129305df21f930552f9a4c6305afb3">Flathead Screwdriver</a><img src="//ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=afoolishmanif-20&l=am2&o=1&a=B000688ANU" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /> | $6 |

I had these basic tools on hand, but you might not.  A crescent wrench would
work instead of the pliers but crescent wrenches are a big hassle so I avoid
them.  You'll also need a bottle to put the soda in; I used a 1L bottle since my
2L bottle still has soda in it.  As long as you can screw on the carbonator cap
it should be fine.

First, put together the gas line assembly:

<a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/frew/29202952475/in/dateposted-public/" title="Gas Line Assembly 1"><img src="https://c4.staticflickr.com/9/8270/29202952475_64fb9e634d_b.jpg" width="768" height="1024" alt="Gas Line Assembly 1"></a>

Use your screwdriver to tighten the clamp around the ball lock:

<a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/frew/28915034650/in/dateposted-public/" title="Gas Line Assembly 2"><img src="https://c3.staticflickr.com/9/8174/28915034650_b81df85a91_b.jpg" width="768" height="1024" alt="Gas Line Assembly 2"></a>

Next connect the gas line assembly to the regulator.  Don't forget to leave the
clamp on before you connect it!

<a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/frew/29202951625/in/dateposted-public/" title="Gas Line Assembly and Regulator 1"><img src="https://c2.staticflickr.com/9/8259/29202951625_a5d47476a6_b.jpg" width="768" height="1024" alt="Gas Line Assembly and Regulator 1"></a>

Tighten the clamp with your screwdriver from before:

<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/frew/28915031790/in/dateposted-public/" title="Gas Line Assembly and Regulator 2"><img src="https://c7.staticflickr.com/9/8583/28915031790_9a0e2db628_b.jpg" width="768" height="1024" alt="Gas Line Assembly and Regulator 2"></a>

Connect the regulator to the tank; you'll need the wrench or pliers to tighten
it sufficiently:

<a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/frew/29202956555/in/dateposted-public/" title="Regulator and Tank"><img src="https://c4.staticflickr.com/9/8119/29202956555_4d207895d1_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Regulator and Tank"></a>

Follow instructions:

<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/frew/28915034520/in/dateposted-public/" title="Always follow instructions"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8072/28915034520_4713c2d0e5_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Always follow instructions"></a>

Screw on the carbonator cap:

<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/frew/28915031570/in/dateposted-public/" title="Carbonator Cap and Bottle"><img src="https://c3.staticflickr.com/9/8411/28915031570_241ee65ef0_b.jpg" width="768" height="1024" alt="Carbonator Cap and Bottle"></a>

Connect the gas line assembly to the carbonator cap.  Pull back the ball lock:

<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/frew/29202950745/in/dateposted-public/" title="Carbonator Cap and Gas Line Assembly 1"><img src="https://c2.staticflickr.com/9/8485/29202950745_ee6b5d82b6_b.jpg" width="768" height="1024" alt="Carbonator Cap and Gas Line Assembly 1"></a>

and push it onto the cap till it's flush:

<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/frew/28582621393/in/dateposted-public/" title="Carbonator Cap and Gas Line Assembly 2"><img src="https://c2.staticflickr.com/9/8327/28582621393_a8d36b085a_b.jpg" width="768" height="1024" alt="Carbonator Cap and Gas Line Assembly 2"></a>

The complete assembly will look like this:

<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/frew/28915031460/in/dateposted-public/" title="Fully Assembled"><img src="https://c5.staticflickr.com/9/8043/28915031460_2a2a21ec72_b.jpg" width="768" height="1024" alt="Fully Assembled"></a>

### Make soda!

So that everything is abundantly clear, here is the assembly with labels:

<a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/frew/28922496930/in/dateposted-public/" title="Carbonation Rig with Labels"><img src="https://c3.staticflickr.com/9/8606/28922496930_d13d18fe12_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Carbonation Rig with Labels"></a>

My system has no inlet gauge, but if it did, it would be where the label is. The
inlet gauge measures how much CO₂ you have, and the outlet gauge measures how
much pressure is in regulator.  The tank knob opens the tank to the regulator,
the regulator knob allows (a regulated amount of) pressure into the regulator,
and the regulator valve allows the gas assembly (and thus the bottle) to be
included in the regulator system.

I zero the system first so I know everything is normal.

 1. **Make sure the tank knob is turned all the way tight** (which is how I store
    my tank.)
 2. Connect the carbonator cap to the gas line assembly, but not screwed into a
    bottle.
 3. Open the valve at the bottom of the regulator.  Now the outlet gauge should
    be at zero.
 4. Remove the carbonator cap and turn off the regulator valve.

So as I said before, I started with seltzer.  All you need for this is water and
a bottle.  There is a relationship to water temperature, pressure, and the
solubility of the CO₂.  Or in layman's terms: get the water good and cold, so
that as much CO₂ as possible will go into the water.  I put about a half a cup
of crushed ice into the 1L bottle, filled it till it had a headroom of another
half a cup of air, and then shook it till the ice melted.  Prechilled water
would be easier, less of a hassle, and if your ice maker is like mine: better
tasting.

  1. Once you have the water ready, connect the bottle to the gas line assembly
     as explained in the [last step
     above](#assemble-the-carbonator:ccba600c70c7f677c13e1f8637f3c2b5).
  2. Unscrew the tank knob a few turns.
  3. Open the regulator valve so that it's in the on position (parallel with the
     tube.)  
  4. Turn the regulator knob till it's showing 40 psi.  This is confusing: you
     turn clockwise to increase pressure.  The water should be pressurized now.
  5. Shake the bottle (I shook for about 30 seconds) to help get the CO₂ into
     the water.
  6. Turn the regulator valve back into the off position.
  7. Disconnect the carbonator cap from the gas line assembly.
  8. Replace the carbonator cap with a plastic cap.
  9. If you are only doing one bottle, close the tank knob.
 10. Enjoy your soda!

<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/frew/29202950225/in/dateposted-public/" title="Enjoy!"><img src="https://c2.staticflickr.com/9/8655/29202950225_534c69f095_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Enjoy!"></a>

## Cost Breakdown

I mentioned that cost could be a reason to do this.  To justify it, here is the
total cost breakdown and when this setup "pays for itself."

Here's the generic equation I came up with to solve for when it's worth getting
the carbonator:

```
amount of liters to break even =
      (upfront carbonator cost - other upfront cost       ) /
      (per liter other cost    - per liter carbonator cost)
```

| Type       | Upfront Cost | Recurring Cost | Recurring Cost per Liter | Break Even |
|------------|--------------|----------------|--------------------------|------------|
| Carbonator | $121    | $20 / 5lb of CO₂ = 100 Gallons = 378 L | 5¢ | ∅ |
| Sodastream | <a  href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00EPEALEM/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B00EPEALEM&linkCode=as2&tag=afoolishmanif-20&linkId=04ba229dc4c3d89be1ec48b8ea04766d">$74</a><img src="//ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=afoolishmanif-20&l=am2&o=1&a=B00EPEALEM" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /> | <a  href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0092H2K6E/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B0092H2K6E&linkCode=as2&tag=afoolishmanif-20&linkId=8c8e9f43d111e2679a4f9c9a35895079">$64.44 / 180 L</a><img src="//ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=afoolishmanif-20&l=am2&o=1&a=B0092H2K6E" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /> | 35¢ | 143 L = *one refill* |
| Store brand | 0 | $2 / 12 pack 12 floz cans = 7.2 L | 27¢ | 550 L = 1550 cans = 129 twelve packs |
| Schwepps | 0 | $5 / 6 pack of 10 floz bottles = 1.8 L | $2.7 | 45 L = 152 bottles = 25 six packs |
| Q | 0 | $6 / 4 pack of 8 floz bottles = 0.9 L | $6.67 | 18 L = 76 bottles = 19 four packs |

Assumptions / Drawbacks: the fundamental premise above is that the soda you are
making is equivalent to what you would be buying.  For the store brand that's
pretty likely.  With Schwepps I'm pretty confident that with a little effort you
could get there.  The Q stuff is likely much harder, though I haven't spent a
lot of effort trying to replicate it yet.  If you are using a Sodastream you are
almost sure to be making exact same product as the carbonator.

The other problem, ignoring the salts added, which is much of what
differentiates the brands, is the water quality.  When I use the filtered water
from my fridge I get pretty good results.  When I use the *ice* from my fridge I
get noticeable off-flavors, which is a pretty big deal when it comes to
something as subtly flavored as plain soda.

## Next steps

### Club Soda

The whole idea (and cost breakdown above!) is that I can make Club Soda with
this.  Typical club sodas contain varying amounts of:

 * Sodium Bicarbonate (baking soda)
 * <a  href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00BLPNMYY/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B00BLPNMYY&linkCode=as2&tag=afoolishmanif-20&linkId=8353d6602c6cf2f2806aba12ec26acd8">Sodium Citrate</a><img src="//ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=afoolishmanif-20&l=am2&o=1&a=B00BLPNMYY" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /> ([you should have this on hand anyway](http://modernistcuisine.com/recipes/silky-smooth-macaroni-and-cheese/))
 * Sodium Chloride (salt)
 * Sodium Phosphate
 * Potassium Sulfate
 * Other salts

I have read that you use 2 teaspoons of salt for 1 L of club soda, but I have
not tested this yet.  I will have a followup post with more detail on this, but
in the meantime, this might get you started.

### Shrubs

You don't need to be able to carbonate a shrub directly in order to make a
shrub, but it seems like a fun idea.  If you don't know what a shrub is, here
are a few links on how to make them:

 * [Serious
   Eats](http://drinks.seriouseats.com/2011/06/cocktail-101-how-to-make-shrub-syrups.html)
 * [About Food](http://cocktails.about.com/od/cocktailspeak/fl/What-is-a-Shrub.htm)
 * [Imbibe Magazine](http://imbibemagazine.com/homemade-drinking-vinegars/)

### Gin and Tonics

Dave Arnold [makes bottled Gin and
Tonics](http://www.foodandwine.com/blogs/how-mixologist-dave-arnold-makes-perfect-gin-and-tonic-and-how-you-can-too)
with quinine sulfate, sugar, clarified lime juice, gin, and water, all carbonated
in a bottle.  I'd like to try that, but the clarified lime is too much right now
(you need a centrifuge.)  On top of that, for some reason tonic makes me
nauseous nowadays, so I might try simply Gin and Club Soda.


### Carbonated Chocolate Milk

One of my friends told me that he carbonated chocolate milk and really enjoyed
that.  It should be really easy to try.  Another friend compared the idea to an
egg cream, which I have not had so that's not helpful to me, but maybe for you,
dear reader.

### More Typical Soda

I'd like to try to make a good root beer, since my wife and I drink it every
Saturday in root beer floats, but I suspect that that is even more work than I
have done just for the carbonator.

I also am interested in some basic sodas, like a lemongrass tea soda or a
chamomile tea soda, or other simple beverages like that that are refreshing and
interesting.

I hope this is as informative as anyone could want out of a post like this.  I
know it would have helped me.  If you are interested in this, but not my more
typical programming topics, you can check out the [drinks
tag](/tags/drinks/) and even subscribe to [an rss feed just for that
tag](/tags/drinks/index.xml) if that's your jam.

## Special Thanks

My friend [C4 of Awesome Brewers, Great Job!](http://awesomebrewers.com/) was
the one who gave me the initial bill of materials for this, and deserves a lot
of credit for this happening.  Thanks C4!  Thee4!
