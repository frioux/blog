Probably once a week in the DBIx::Class channel someone asks if there is a way
to pass arguments to a relationship.  There is an answer but it isn't pretty or
for the faint of heart, so I finally have decided that I should write up a post
detailing how to do it and nicely hide it from the user.

## Extended Relationship Refresher

The first tool to use when defining
a parameterized relationship is an [extended
relationship](https://blog.afoolishmanifesto.com/posts/dbix-class-extended-relationships/).
The fundamental trick here is that we're leveraging the fact that a coderef is
able to have access to some variable.  Note that I've never even felt the need
for this, and I'm still not totally sure why it needs to be part of the
relationship instead of a simple resultset method, but we'll leave that aside
for now.

(See
[::RelationshipDWIM](https://blog.afoolishmanifesto.com/posts/dbix-class-helper-row-relationshipdwim-awesome/)
and
[::Candy](https://blog.afoolishmanifesto.com/posts/announcing-dbix-class-candy/)
for part of why these rels are a little shorter than normal.)

Here's an example parameterized relationship:

    package My::Schema::Result::Foo;

    ...

    our $SHARE_TYPE;
    has_many output_devices => '::OutputDevice', sub {
       my $args = shift;
       
       die "no share_type specified!" unless $SHARE_TYPE;

       my %shared = ( "$args->{foreign_alias}.shared" => $SHARE_TYPE );
       
       return ({
          "$args->{foreign_alias}.user" =>
             { -ident => "$args->{self_alias}.user" },
          %shared,
       },
       $args->{self_rowobj} && {
          "$args->{foreign_alias}.user" => $args->{self_rowobj}->user,
          %shared,
       });
    };

The way the user can use this relationship is as follows:

    my @rows = do {
       local $My::Schema::Result::Foo::SHARE_TYPE = [1, 2];
       $rs->search(undef, { join => 'output_devices' })->all
    };

## ResultSet Method

That's a little gross, so lets wrap it in a resultset method:

    package My::Schema::ResultSet::Foo;

    ...

    sub by_output_devices_share_type {
       my ($self, $share_type) = @_;

       local $My::Schema::Result::Foo::SHARE_TYPE = [1, 2];
       $self->search(undef, { join => 'output_devices' })->all
    }

And then to use it the user would write:

    $rs->by_output_devices_share_type([1, 2])->all

## PerchÃ©?

But why?  That's what I don't understand.  The user could also write the
following:

    package My::Schema::Result::Foo;
    
    ...
    
    has_many output_devices => '::OutputDevice',
      { 'foreign.user' => 'self.user' };
    
    ...
    
    package My::Schema::ResultSet::Foo;
    
    ...
    
    sub by_output_devices_share_type {
       my ($self, $share_type) = @_;

       $self->search({
         'output_devices.shared' => $share_type,
       }, { join => 'output_devices' })->all
    }

The user interface is the same:

    $rs->by_output_devices_share_type([1, 2])->all

The whole thing is much simpler.  There *might* be an argument that filtering in
the `JOIN` expression can produce a better optimized query.  But that's it.
