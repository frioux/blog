![Reading Minds](/wp-content/uploads/2007/08/readingminds2.png)

Today I tried to read minds, _numerous_ times. I had no success at all. I tried just casually *trying* to read both Edgar and J-Curly's minds. I also tried physical touch, touching foreheads, imagining reading a book with their thought's on it, and numerous other things. No luck at all my friends!

Tomorrow the kiddies move in. Hopefully they are a quantifiable amount of awesome, right? What is the unit for quantifiable awesome you ask? It's a gnarl. How does one define a gnarl? Maybe I'll do that rigorously tomorrow.
