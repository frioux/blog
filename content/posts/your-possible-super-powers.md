I was thinking about super powers the other day and I came to a realization; even if I do have super powers I rarely try to do things that require super powers so I might have some super powers and not even know it! This could be true of all of us! I mean, honestly, how often do you try to fly, or double jump, or breath underwater, or walk through walls? Not that often right? Or what about the more obscure superpowers, like being able to read a 5.25" floppy disk with your index finger, or singing and having your voice double into a radio wave on the radio station 105.9 KISS FM? Or what if your super power were helping Shakespeare to write 29 MORE plays, but sadly you were born way too late?

From now on I am going to try a new super power AT LEAST once a day. I will try my best to keep you updated on my progress.

(This is not what happened. I only jumped the first time; the second time I just kinda flailed.)
