This week I finished the following three git conversions:

- Catalyst-Authentication-Store-DBIx-Class
- Catalyst-Authentication-Credential-FBConnect
- Catalyst-Authentication-Credential-OAuth

And I started on the following four git conversions (I think they are ready but
I want t0m to sign off on them) :

- Task-Catalyst
- Catalyst-Plugin-Authentication
- HTTP-Request-AsCGI
- Catalyst-Action-RenderView
