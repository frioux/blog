![Walking Through Walls](/wp-content/uploads/2007/09/walkingthroughwalls.png)

I tried walking through walls and had no luck. I tried both cinder-block and
wood. I also tried willing myself through, imagining walking through, "just
doing it," and probably others that I don't remember. J-Dot was there which is
why this gets his seal of approval.

In other news, my laptop's power plug slot thing got broken, so my whole laptop
was broken. GOAT and I looked up the part online, bought it (thanks
laptopjacks,) and soldered it in. This is of course after taking the entire
thing apart (it was deeply hidden inside.) Interestingly, I had saved every
little bit of plastic and whatnot while taking it apart and one of those pieces
of plastic turned out to be a transistor that broke off when the plug thing
broke. We soldered that in as well. After we put it back together it worked!
Wow! Pretty cool. Anyway, I am probably going to look into getting a new one
soonish anyway, so if anyone has any ideas, let me know.
