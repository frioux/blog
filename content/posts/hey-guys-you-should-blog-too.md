Ok that article is really long. Here's the breakdown. Basically Matthew S Trout,
the main guy who makes DBIx::Class, made a similar observation as
[other](https://web.archive.org/web/20130210084442/http://desert-island.me.uk/~castaway/blog/looking-for-perl-signals.html)
[people](/archives/64). More specifically, Perl people don't blog enough. With
that in mind Mr. Trout gives some compelling reasons to start! So read the
article.

Also: lots of things are coming out lately! Ubuntu 9.04 just got pushed to my laptop, and my phone is gonna get updated from 1.1 to 1.5 (read: on screen keyboard!) in less than two weeks! Woo! WOO!
