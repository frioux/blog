A friend [recently mentioned an idea](https://twitter.com/rjbs/status/436256223126888448) of a club where you play the games you get in the humble bundle and then talk about it afterwards. Kinda a solution to the whole problem where you get a bunch of games from steam sales, humble indie bundles, or just plain excess but then never play them. I decided to do it with some friends at work who already play games anyway. The goal isn't to write an essay, but merely write a brief review, especially if the game sucked. You have to play it for at least an hour though. Here's my first post.

# [The Swapper](http://facepalmgames.com/the-swapper/)

The Swapper is a platformer in the vein of Metroid and Limbo. It has some really interesting puzzles that were fun to figure out. The platforming is more like Limbo, in that it's not a lot about timing and more about figuring out what to do. It is like Metroid in that it's a very "gated" game. So far I haven't come across a gate that I had to come back to after solving another gate, like in Metroid, so it's still relatively casual, at least the first hour in.

The story is pretty interesting. It has about three layers. I don't want to say too much on this level for fear of spoiling some of it. I like it.

One thing that's important to me is that I can play games on my couch without a keyboard and mouse. This game does ok there, the gamepad support is fine, though a tad more configurability might be nice. Playing on the couch is a little frustrating though because there are a lot of parts with really small text. I appreciate the small text typography, but I just wish they had some way to make it bigger for couch usage.

I am pretty sure I will play the rest of this game.
