![Controlling Water](/wp-content/uploads/2007/08/controllingwater.png)

Today I tried to \*Control Water\*. It was interesting because I was not really sure what to try (I really want to try flying, but I want to try out a lot before I attempt that one) and whilst wondering \_what\_ I should try the big bottled water thing at my house seemed to randomly bubble. I figured that that might have been a sign and that I might as well try controlling water. Sadly, after trying numerous methods to reproduce the previous results, nothing happened. So it goes right?

In other news, tomorrow I am going to begin on my Go Board. I have wanted to construct one for a long time, and I am going to work on it with my dad, so I am pretty stoked. If anyone has any awesome ideas for painting the lines (normally you do it with what looks like an Italian pizza cutter) let me know.
