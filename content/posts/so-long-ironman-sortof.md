The [IronMan](http://ironman.enlightenedperl.org/) initiative is awesome! No one should misunderstand that. But I am getting WAY TOO MANY things in my feed reader. So here's my solution:

1. unsubscribe from from the vanilla feed.
2. Add the [OPML](http://ironman.enlightenedperl.org/subscriptions.opml) to my feed reader and then unsubscribe from the non-english and spam feeds
3. work on the IronMan code base to add another feed of when people add their feed, and then subscribe to that so I know when people join
4. profit!

Anyway, if anyone wants to help with that second to last one I'd appreciate it since plagger is CRAZY.
