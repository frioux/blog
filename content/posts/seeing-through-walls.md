![Seeing Through Walls](/wp-content/uploads/2007/08/clairvoyance2.png) Today I tried to see through walls. J-Box stood on the other side of an eight-inch cinder block wall and made hand signals and I tried to see what the signals were. I tried looking through the wall, touching the wall with my hand and forehead, and guessing. I was wrong every single time. Guess not this time!

In other news, I am having this tea my mom sent me called Crepe Faire and it is THE BEST HERBAL TEA I have ever had. Also, if you want to laugh joyously enjoy Flight of the Conchords on YouTube. Fun will abound!
