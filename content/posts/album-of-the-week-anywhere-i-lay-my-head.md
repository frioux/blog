This week's Album of the Week is <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0014IH1N6/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B0014IH1N6&linkCode=as2&tag=afoolishmanif-20&linkId=36b151864a78d7349e90f5420ca37ea0">Anywhere I Lay My Head</a><img src="//ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=afoolishmanif-20&l=am2&o=1&a=B0014IH1N6" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /> by Scarlett Johansson. The album is comprised of Tom Waits covers done by Johansson. According to my friend Neil and also Internet, Dave Sitek, also made quite the impression on the album as a whole.

The main impression one gets from the album is it's muddled sound. It's as if Johansson is singing from the bottom of a lake or something. That has a lot to do with all of the effects on the songs. I think it gives the album an interesting feel. I have one friend that when he listens to it he can't get through a song because he just wants to listen to Tom Waits originals.

I think this album is good for listening to when you are feeling introspective and the Nuckelavee are after you. If you need some solace from the outside world let Scarlett envelop you with her voice while Tom Waits sings through her.
