Ok, so when I was in school, I trained some guys on perl (and other things) over the summer via email. I decided to resurrect the tutorials so more people could use them. The idea is that they are good for programmers because they don't explain the basics of what arrays are etc. Anyway, hope someone digs it! [Perl Tutorial 1](/perl-tutorials/perl-1-and-a-little-bit-of-linux). Have fun!
