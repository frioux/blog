I say "station" all the time and people never seem to know why.  Here's why.

<!--more-->

In 1991 Bill and Ted's Bogus Journey was released.  In the film, Bill (Alex
Winter) and Ted (Keanu Reeves) are murdered by evil robot versions of themselves
from the future.  They end up in heaven, after beating death at various games,
escaping hell, and finally mugging some people who, presumably, belonged there,
and taking their clothes.

In heaven they (at this point Bill, Ted, *and* the grim reaper) approach God and
ask him for help in their predicament.  God responds with a single word:
**STATION** and, through a strange map, introduces our protagonists to two
Martians who are both named station and only use one word to communicate:
station.
