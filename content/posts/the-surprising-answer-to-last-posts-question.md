Yesterday I asked "[Module::Build? EU::MM?](/archives/862)". Turns out that was
a false dichotomy! Almost everyone who responded to my post recommended
[Module::Install](http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Module::Install), which is cool
since it's what we use at work because of the Catalyst swap. We never had any
kind of install method before :-)

Although I would also point out that I hope that this choice is pointless for
personal project, as I hope to use
[Dist::Zilla](http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Dist::Zilla).

Have a nice weekend!
