Before I get into specifics I need to tell a story about how I got into Marillion...

I found out I loved prog music because of Transatlantic. Marillion's Pete
Trewavas is one of the members of Transatlantic. I checked out all of the other
band member's groups, but I never did check out Marillion (as in order a CD.)
One day I was in the thrift store and I happened upon a Marillion album
(<a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000005RPT/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B000005RPT&linkCode=as2&tag=afoolishmanif-20&linkId=7876195ef37c5a429ff6b9adf1e559d2">Seasons End</a><img src="//ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=afoolishmanif-20&l=am2&o=1&a=B000005RPT" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />)
It was surprisingly good and I bought up a few more albums (<a  href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00004W3L3/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B00004W3L3&linkCode=as2&tag=afoolishmanif-20&linkId=d0e9cee7e97a5f8cf98d9e3906c7f457">Misplaced Childhood</a><img src="//ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=afoolishmanif-20&l=am2&o=1&a=B00004W3L3" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />)
Anyway, I just cannot believe that I found music that excellent at a thrift store.

Back to Brave. Brave is one of the earlier Marillion albums, yet it still falls into the "Hogarth" era Marillion. I would compare Marillion with Radiohead, except I don't really like Radiohead enough to know them that well. Marillion often has fairly dark music, and Brave is no exception. I have never actually noticed the lyrics on Brave (except for The Great Escape,) but Brave is a concept album. I recommend reading the lyrics instead of listening to me about that though.

I would also describe this album as very heartfelt; that is, I would say that feeling and meaning tend to bleed through. I would compare this to how I feel about The Arcade Fire.

Brave is one of those albums that you really should listen to in its entirety. It has a great intro and an excellent finale. Brave is a good album to listen to when it's pouring rain out and you just feel like brooding.

Favorites: Bridge, Living with the Big Lie, Hard as Love, Brave, The Great Escape.

Colors: Black, Navy.
