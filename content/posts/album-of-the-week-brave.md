Before I get into specifics I need to tell a story about how I got into Marillion...

I found out I loved prog music because of [Transatlantic](http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fentity%2FTransatlantic%2FB000APMKDA%3Fie%3DUTF8%26ref%255F%3Dntt%255Fmus%255Fgen%255Fpel&tag=afooman-20&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=390957)![](https://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=afooman-20&l=ur2&o=1). Marillion's Pete Trewavas is one of the members of Transatlantic. I checked out all of the other band member's groups, but I never did check out Marillion (as in order a CD.) One day I was in the thrift store and I happened upon a Marillion album ([Season's End](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000005RPT?ie=UTF8&tag=afooman-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B000005RPT)![](http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=afooman-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B000005RPT).) It was surprisingly good and I bought up a few more albums ([Misplaced Childhood](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00004W3L3?ie=UTF8&tag=afooman-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00004W3L3)![](http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=afooman-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B00004W3L3), [Fugazi](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000006NED?ie=UTF8&tag=afooman-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B000006NED)![](http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=afooman-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B000006NED), and some other one I can't find.) Anyway, I just cannot believe that I found music that excellent at a thrift store.

Back to Brave. Brave is one of the earlier Marillion albums, yet it still falls into the "Hogarth" era Marillion. I would compare Marillion with Radiohead, except I don't really like Radiohead enough to know them that well. Marillion often has fairly dark music, and Brave is no exception. I have never actually noticed the lyrics on Brave (except for The Great Escape,) but Brave is a concept album. I recommend reading the lyrics instead of listening to me about that though.

I would also describe this album as very heartfelt; that is, I would say that feeling and meaning tend to bleed through. I would compare this to how I feel about The Arcade Fire.

Brave is one of those albums that you really should listen to in its entirety. It has a great intro and an excellent finale. Brave is a good album to listen to when it's pouring rain out and you just feel like brooding.

Favorites: Bridge, Living with the Big Lie, Hard as Love, Brave, The Great Escape.

Colors: Black, Navy.
