![Mind Control](/wp-content/uploads/2007/08/mindcontrol2.png) Today I tried to tell J' to get me a drink of water with my mind. I imagined him getting it, I told him in my mind to get it, I even told him out loud (but not loud enough for him to hear) to get me a glass of water. He claimed that he was thinking of escalators, but that's not really the same at all, so you know, no mind control for me. This is a really complicated one though, because what if it's just control of the female mind, or the animal mind, or one specific person's mind? I'll investigate more later.

In other news, I put together my desktop computer, which is super exciting. I have music and dual monitors and all that jazz. I missed that guy for the past three months! Also: 533 updates is a lot for three months. Lastly, I came up with a lot of ideas of power to try out yesterday so I doubt there will be much of a dearth of fun free fREWbish thoughts for silly people to read. Station.
