You may have noticed that there really aren't a lot of CPAN Ratings out there currently, but you have a chance to help that. The past couple of weeks I've done two or three CPAN ratings every Thursday. Just go to [CPAN Ratings](http://cpanratings.perl.org/), get an account, and rate modules that you are a fan of.

Generally criticizing modules in active development is a bad idea since bugs should really go to [rt](https://rt.cpan.org/). But if the module is "done" and there are bugs, a bad review might be feasible.

Anyway, Happy CPAN Ratings day!!
