![Controlling the Weather](/wp-content/uploads/2007/08/controllingweather2.png) Today I tried to control the weather. I tried to create lightning, clouds, and a tornado. I tried the regular tricks of imagination, will, and word. Maybe there is a \*\*power word\*\* that I need to learn that will let me do these kind of things. Or maybe it's more like a muscle and I just need to learn how to use the muscle. If only I had directions!

Today was long. Sleep will be good. Tomorrow we upgrade the loft as well as awesomate. I'm stoked. I might be able to get a couch too, but more realistically that will be Saturday. The land-locked machine is about a half done with it's six hundred updates. WONDERFUL.
