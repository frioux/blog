This is a three part post, but it's supposed to be short, so lets get to it!

# Part I: Shorter Blog Posts

I like to blog, but my posts tend to get really long and involved, because I
sorta like to think from first principles and build up and tend to teach that
way also.  It's generally not great; my documentation usually has something to
be desired after I'm done.  I think I'm a pretty good communicator, but I need
to be better at succinctly and *also* clearly documenting.

Here I go again.  I also need to **just write**!  So I'm making a rule that most
posts need to be pretty short.  We're talking like, 80 lines Ã— 80 chars.  So at
this point I'm nearly a quarter through my post...

# Part II: Looking Back on 2014

Last year I didn't make any kind of goals at the new year, and I haven't done
that in a **long** time, which I'm fine with.  I did some stuff I'm pretty
stoked about nonetheless!

 * I started using DBIx::Introspector in anger, which lead to ::DateMethods1,
   and more excitingly for me at work, our application is nearly 100% working on
   SQL Server as well as Postgres.

 * I took and completed a class on Coursera.  It was programming languages,
   which I didn't get around to taking in college.  Thanks to RJBS for
   instigating that.  I'm in a crypto one now and it's way harder, but still
   really interesting.

 * Had a kid.  That mostly just means it's harder for me to plan for next year!

 * Did a good amount of async code for work; this is getting more and more
   exciting every day.  I'm really enjoying IO::Async and for better or worse,
   enjoying finding bugs and helping get them fixed.

 * Learned a lot about TLS, x509, et al.  I have always been interested in
   crypto, and we're rolling it out in a big way at work.  It's been really
   interesting and fun to get going.

 * LESS LESS LESS!  Early on in my career I had fun creating applications using
   big framework-y type stuff like Catalyst, DBIx::Class, etc.  I still really
   like those things, but now I tend to work hard to avoid even having a
   database connection.  Similarly, I tend to start off with Web::Simple and
   often run it under IO::Async, since that lets me have background tasks
   without any kind of message queue.  It's a lot of fun and I really like it.

 * Surely there's more, but who knows!

# Part III: 2015

It's hard to say what 2015 will look like.  This time last year I was awaiting a
callback from Google to see if I'd get an offer, and shortly thereafter found
out we were having a kid.  I am really excited to do more async, crypto, and
non-win32 (hence Pg) work at $work.

One of our new products which I started last year but will likely finish in the
first half of this year is a piece of hardware based on the Raspberry Pi.  It's
a single async perl process all running on (of course) Linux.  It's a lot of fun
to work on too!

The first part of this blog post might make it clear that I want to write more.
I do!  And honestly, I think even this, which I'm writing over the course of
like, *maybe* 30 minutes, is still too long.  But it has three parts so
whatever.  So yeah, more little posts.  I want something between long, technical
posts, and twitter.

Some non-tech things I want to do this year are: get more handy and fix stuff in
my 30 year old house; drawers; insulation; shelving; etc.  I want to figure out
where my motivation disappears to for (at worst) weeks on end and how to recover
it.  I want to reduce monthly cost of living if possible (ie cancel cable.)  I
want to go deeper with some of my hobbies like cocktails and cooking.

That's enough, or even too much.  Have a good 2015 everyone!
