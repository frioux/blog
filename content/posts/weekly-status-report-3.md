I don't feel great about this past week, but I was really busy with wedding
planning stuff. I barely made either of my two main goals (2 blog posts and 2
patches/releases a week.)

Last week I:

- Released a [new version](https://metacpan.org/module/FREW/Log-Contextual-0.004001/lib/Log/Contextual.pm) of [Log::Contextual](https://metacpan.org/module/Log::Contextual)
- Released a [new version](https://metacpan.org/release/FREW/DBIx-Class-Helpers-2.007001) of [DBIx::Class::Helpers](https://metacpan.org/module/DBIx::Class::Helpers)

I have high hopes for the coming week, that I can get more important releases
and more interesting blog posts written. Stay tuned!
