![Creation of Small, Simple Objects](/wp-content/uploads/2007/10/creationofsmallobjects2.png)

Today I tried to make a diamond. I tried to make it both out of nothing and with a piece of wadded up paper. I couldn't do it, sadly. So these things go right? The tests are going to get harder soon; I'll need to try to control massive amounts of people somehow and whatnot. Wish me luck on such endeavours.

In other news, the dentist said to brush my teeth and avoid drill happy dentists. Awesome?
