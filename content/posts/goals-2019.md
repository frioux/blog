As many do, I am attempting to affect 2019 by picking skills to improve,
subjects to learn, ways I hope to improve as a person, and then deriving
(hopefully) concrete milestones to benchmark that progress.

<!--more-->

## 2018

Before I dive in, I want to briefly look back on 2018 and the goals I set for
that year and how it worked out.  I didn't publish these anywhere generally
accessible, but I did publish them to about two dozen people so I can say I
called my shot.  For brevity I'm going to only discuss the general goals and
not the milestones.

### Skills To Improve

I wanted to "consistently read quality non-fiction."  This is mostly a reaction
against Twitter.  I read a handful of non-fiction books last year but
fell off the wagon around October.  It was mostly a success in that I was able
to actually do it and I think that the books I read were mostly "quality,"
though at some point that becomes a no-true-scotsman.  This strongly influences
my primary goal for 2019.

I wanted to cook more. I would call this a failure.  I probably cook once or
twice a week, and that was a milestone, but I was intending to cook something
I'd never cooked before once a week, and for some reason I find this
exceptionally exhausting.  Tabling this for 2019.

I wanted to get back into the habit of exercise, which was a success.  I do a
relatively brief workout two times per week.  I *might* try replacing one of
those workouts with a jog to the beach, which I love doing but takes up a lot of
time.  No longer a goal but a habit.

### Subjects to Learn

Both of the subjects I set out to learn / improve on were related to my job.
I'm not sure that's good or bad.

First off I wanted to get some basic grounding in Machine Learning.  I started
this off before 2018 started, but that's fine.  The first of January isn't
magical.  I basically took [Andrew Ng's Machine Learning
Class](/posts/reflections-on-ngs-machine-learning/) and then didn't do anything
else.  I'm ok with that for now but admit that I'm not exactly a machine
learning lord.

Next I wanted to improve on my SRE knowledge.  This is almost literally my job
title, so while I am motivated to improve, I also already do a lot of the basic
tenets of "SRE" so it's incremental improvements.  The main thing I did was
finish the original

and started on the new

I intend to finish the Workbook and then after that focus on the concrete stuff
[at work.](https://www.ziprecruiter.com/hiring/technology)

It's happened countless times that I feel nervous or guilty about not doing
something at work because I feel pressured for time, only for leadership to then
make it a specific requirement later.  I need to trust my gut more and act.

### Ways to Improve

The goals here are basically general terms for being a better parent.  I made
them general but at least for the first goal it doesn't even apply to any other
sphere of life.

For 2018 I wanted to be more patient and less angry with my kids.  I am not a
zen monk, but I am more even keeled than I was when 2017 ended.  I can take some
credit for this, but a lot of it surely goes to my kids for being a little older
and a little more mature than they were then.

The hardest thing for me is when Roman (4) is illogical and emotional.  I know I
sound like a robot saying that, but when a kid is sobbing and angry because the
cat won't make their breakfast, I think most people would be at least a little
frustrated.  I also think that I can give

some of the credit for the success here.

Another goal was to multitask when I needed to, but singletask when possible.
This was a failure in that I gave up, but a success in that I think it's just a
bad idea.  More on this for 2019.

## 2019

I'm structuring my goals for 2019 similarly to 2018.

### Skills

The first skill I want to focus on is <u>executive judgement</u>.  I thought that this
was a general, widely accepted term but after doing a touch of research I can't
find evidence to back that up.  I am happy to adopt a better term if someone
suggests one.  Anyway, when I say executive judgement I mean taking a step back
and thinking about what I am doing from the big picture.  Concrete examples of
this are realizing that some book I'm reading doesn't do anything for me, or
that some blog post is not worth reading or finishing, or that I should change
direction entirely.  I think the main way this will show up in 2019 will be
giving up on things I shouldn't even be doing in the first place.

I think another way of thinking about this is: how do you make decisions?  There
are a few ways to make better decisions: rules of thumb, habits (ie avoiding
decisions,) and finally, getting better at decisions themselves, which is what
I'm aiming at.  I believe that decisions made "by default" are probably
reasonable, but suboptimal, and lead to things like reading twitter for an hour
straight, or reading a long blog post about some new feature in Windows, etc.

The next skill I want to develop is <u>monotasking</u>.  Really this is a very
specific application of executive judgement.  If I am bouncing back and forth
between twitter, RSS, email, and actual work, I am not really getting anything
done.  I should close the three I am not doing and focus on one.  [I have had
great success lately closing
slack](https://twitter.com/frioux/status/1058377813676314625) so that I can
focus on other things.  I need to make this a habit with more than just slack.

Finally, I want to spend more time <u>writing</u>.  According to my git repo I
wrote about 34 blog posts this year.  That's pretty good!  I'm ok with that
quantity, but I'd rather it be better spread out instead of having months long
gaps between spurts of posts.

### Subjects

When it comes to subjects I'm taking an about face and focusing entirely on
stuff barely relevant to work this year.  The fundamental goal here is to <u>gain
more knowledge in practical fields</u>.  So while it's cool to know about
astrophysics, I don't expect that to be as useful as knowing how to build basic
machines, recognize various plants, and understand cause and effect in history.

To be clear, the examples above are just that.  I am having trouble making a
list of specific subjects that I want to improve.  If I had all the time in the
world I'd try to get a passable grasp of:

 * human anatomy
 * plants
 * weather
 * knots
 * practical physics (building things)
 * history

When I get to the concrete goals later I'll discuss this more.

### Ways to Improve

One of the important things I'd like to get better at is "<u>being present</u>."  I
know this is very in vogue right now, but I feel like it has less to do with it
being popular and more to do with the persistent distractions that surround us.
Arguably this is a reframing of monotasking.  That's fine.

Finally, I intend to use
<a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0143126563/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0143126563&linkCode=as2&tag=afoolishmanif-20&linkId=63a3b182ab1426718fccee661c0daea6">my planning system</a><img src="//ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=afoolishmanif-20&l=am2&o=1&a=0143126563" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />
better, specifically by spreading out tasks in my contextual todo list.  I've
been slacking and just putting any and all tasks in the "anywhere" context
(including articles retrieved via rss!) and that breaks the whole model.  My
plan instead is to try to avoid the "anywhere" context whenever possible.  We'll
see how it goes.

### Concrete Goals

My concrete goals are pretty distinct from the above general goals.  I'm ok with
that, but if it were at work I'd accuse whoever wrote them as justifying them
rather than deriving them.

#### Monthly Learning Days

The idea here is from something [I wrote on
twitter](https://twitter.com/frioux/status/1070161562239827968) a while ago.
Basically, I can't really go to conferences as much as I used to because of kids
and some work travel that I need to do, so I hope to make private
miniconferences comprised of recorded videos, blog posts, and tiny projects.
They would be typically about a day but I'd like to leave open the option of
three day ones maybe once or twice a year.

I would expect to spend about an hour planning each one, though having not done
this before I'm probably way off on that estimate. Some example topics might
include:

 * game development, maybe just by reading pico-8 cart code
 * music, possibly by just covering songs with my guitar or pico-8 tracker
 * recorded video from professionally relevant conferences (Go, Perl,
     Performance, SRE, etc)

Afterwards I'd like to write up a brief report, including the schedule, any
important takeaways, etc.  To keep this lightweight I'd like the report to be
less than 500 words, preferably 250 words.  If I am able to do this it will
satisfy monotastking, executive judgement, and writing goals.

I want to do the first one of these very soon, maybe the second weekend in
January, since I'm so excited about the idea.

#### Write 200 words/day, publish weekly

This was inspired by [a tweet I
saw](https://twitter.com/frioux/status/1074771176038133760) by someone who has
published some books.  I don't expect to write any books, but I do want to build
a better habit of writing regularly.  I had pretty good results from [publishing
OSS weeky](/posts/farewell-cpan-contest/), though it did end up "rote" which I
think is bad, but I think that's a tradeoff worth making, at least for a year or
two.  I do think that maybe "an edit cycle" can cout as the 200 words, since
inserting links, coming up with social media posts, etc, can take a solid half
hour.

#### Avoid mulitasking

I only will multitask when I have to, for example I can do dishes or pay bills
when the kids are around, but I can't read blog posts or program (unless it's for
a production incident.)  Similarly, while it can be a bit of a relief to pull up
twitter, slack, facebook, or RSS when I am feeling a little spent, I would
rather finish what I'm doing and then spend time set aside for relaxing.  This
is to be more present and enforce monotasking.

#### Avoid Rote Reading

I [read rss](/posts/some-cool-new-tools/#rss) and have ended up mindlessly
reading things that are probably not relevant to my life.  If they are
interesting, that's fine, but they should have the appropriate priority.  I
intend to abandon articles sooner.  I intend to skip, categorize, or
deprioritize articles based on their title.  I intend to track the quality of a
given source and unsubscribe if it takes up too much overhead to skip articles.
This is all to train executive judgement and recover a little bit of my time.

#### Write a sentance for each of Roman, Axel, Catherine, and general gratitude daily

I expect this to be fairly straightforward with benefits daily and down the
road.  I was doing this on and off for the boys for a while and would really
like to keep up, if only to show them when they get older some of the silly or
cute things they did.  I am typically a grateful person, but putting it in words
seems good.

#### Learn Knots

I've been learning various knots for a few months just because I think they are
intersting.  While I can tie a lot of them pretty well, I tend to not remember
which I should use or remember how to tie them with slight changes in angle,
rope, etc.  So I intend to continue learning knots, and using varying kinds of
rope and string and in different angles so that I can remember them when I need
to.

A cool side note is that I got
<a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0385040253/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0385040253&linkCode=as2&tag=afoolishmanif-20&linkId=111a2285f30182da55c62835c9aa15d1">The Ashley Book of Knots</a><img src="//ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=afoolishmanif-20&l=am2&o=1&a=0385040253" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />
for Christmas, which
is fascinating and probably the most important reference on the topic.  This is
to satisfy the goal of learning more in practical fields.

We'll see how this goes!  I have been surprised at how well just making goals
has worked for me in the past few years.  Maybe I only remember what's gone
well, or decide that the stuff that went poorly doesn't matter?  We'll see how
this year goes.  I have no illusions of monthly or quarterly updates, but
probably will have another retrospective in 2020 if I think it's worth doing.
