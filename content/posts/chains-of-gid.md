It's 2AM.  My wife and infant son are in bed.  He's teething so most of the
interaction I have with her involves yelling over him and tense enjoyment of
brief respites gifted by small cold things.

I'm awake for two reasons.

The first is that I enjoy the time I get alone.  I tend to take advantage of
this time by programming, watching film, or playing video games.  Tonight I was
especially excited because I got [the PICO-8
fanzine](http://sectordub.itch.io/pico-8-fanzine-1) and [a bunch of new
information regarding Linux
Tracing](http://www.tracingsummit.org/wiki/TracingSummit2015#Schedule) was just
published.

The second reason is that I have yet to release a module to CPAN yet.  I have
somehow stayed on the [Once a Week, Every
Week leaderboard](http://onceaweek.cjmweb.net/current) for more than three
years.  I certainly have a sense of pride from that and I do think that momentum
of releases is worth something.

So here I am, looking at [my list of outstanding
issues](https://github.com/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+author%3Afrioux).
I actually got started on a couple that would qualify but ran into technical
issues for both.

I'm conflicted.  I've actually done a lot this week.  On the public/OSS front I
have:

 * [drafted](https://github.com/kazeburo/Apache-LogFormat-Compiler/pull/8)
   [three](https://github.com/kazeburo/Apache-LogFormat-Compiler/pull/9) [pull
   requests](https://github.com/plack/Plack/pull/515)
 * [worked](https://github.com/frioux/GPGME-FFI/commit/dd182d3b97cd5e16e807bed4132922c42bdc82b2)
   [on
   GPGME](https://github.com/frioux/GPGME-FFI/commit/6d32914d04f42c61cc7975b1fdf7f4314eb68e1d)
   [FFI
   bindings](https://github.com/frioux/GPGME-FFI/commit/463c25f853d6ce3c7e9670bc1032d8d6ed2a1ea9)
 * [worked on my sysdig pstree
   chisel](https://gist.github.com/frioux/2e79524a1af6896c45ed)
 * [wrote a tool to download cartridges for
   PICO-8](https://gist.github.com/frioux/a3a8e32da5f01be43715)
 * [invented a new vim
   workflow](https://github.com/frioux/dotfiles/commit/93d7d4334e520bd6fbde138073714c79d9f65ad1)
 * and of course this blog post

And none of that includes any of the rewarding stuff I've done at work that's
not open to the public!

It's frustrating because I like the weekly release contest; it motivates me to
continue improving and releasing software.  But it optimizes for the little
things.  The GPGME thing above will likely take months to complete, but will
count no more than a release that fixes spelling in documentation.

Similarly, I'd like to do some work with Rust, Go, Julia, and Lua.  I'm making
progress with Lua because I have at least one specific goal, but none of that
will be counted by the contest.

I have to wonder: would making some kind of dashboard that takes all of my
public goals into account make me feel OK ditching the weekly contest?  I don't
know.  Chances are I will release a module tomorrow, somehow, to stay in the
contest.  But I'm starting to think that it's becoming the worst kind of
religion, where it's all about making myself feel good by performing an empty
ceremony.

Don't get me wrong, I'm not burnt out or anything like that; I'm just getting
increasingly dubious of the contest.  Am I the only one?  Is this the reason
that the week count for the contest is so ridiculously "long tailed?"  I hope I
read other opinions about this too.
