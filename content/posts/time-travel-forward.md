![Time Travel (Forward)](/wp-content/uploads/2007/08/timetravelforward2.png)

Yesterday I tried traveling forward in time. It was, as usual, unsuccessful. I tried saying how far forward I wanted to go, imagining the future in 5 minutes, willing myself to the future, and hoping for the future. Again, small increments for the same reason as last time I tried time stuff.

In other, hopefully obvious, news, I changed drawing styles. I like it better. Also I hope to get back into once a day every day. Things are chaotic with moving. Lastly, I have arranged my dream stuff so that I can test super powers in dreams. I still think I will need certain chemicals to *really* test out the powers, but I need to get back into the habit of lucid dreaming anyway. Station.
