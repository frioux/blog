I've been using this for a couple years now, and I figure I'll [repost](http://www.christonium.com/culinaryreview/How_To_Make_Your_Own_Dry_Spicy_Chai_Mix) it so that it's easy to find (for me.)

| Sugar, White Granulated  | 1 Cup        |
| Instant Non Fat Dry Milk | 1 Cup        |
| Non Dairy Creamer        | 1/2 Cup      |
| Instant Tea              | 1/2 Cup      |
| Cinnamon, Ground         | 1 Teaspoon   |
| Ginger, Ground           | 1 Teaspoon   |
| Salt, Table              | 1/2 Teaspoon |
| Nutmeg, Ground           | 1/2 Teaspoon |
| Allspice, Ground         | 1/4 Teaspoon |
| Cloves, Ground           | 1/4 Teaspoon |
| Cayenne Pepper           | 1/8 Teaspoon |

And for convenience, here is the recipe x 4, which is how much I like to make:

| Sugar, White Granulated  | 4 Cup        |
| Instant Non Fat Dry Milk | 4 Cup        |
| Non Dairy Creamer        | 2 Cup        |
| Instant Tea              | 2 Cup        |
| Cinnamon, Ground         | 4 Teaspoon   |
| Ginger, Ground           | 4 Teaspoon   |
| Salt, Table              | 2 Teaspoon   |
| Nutmeg, Ground           | 2 Teaspoon   |
| Allspice, Ground         | 1 Teaspoon   |
| Cloves, Ground           | 1 Teaspoon   |
| Cayenne Pepper           | 1/2 Teaspoon |

Enjoy!
