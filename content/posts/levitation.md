![Levitation](/wp-content/uploads/2007/08/levitation.png)

Today I tried, unsuccessfully, to levitate off of a couch.  I tried it both sitting and laying down.  I must admit that I felt lighter, but certainly not lighter than air.  It was the feeling often expressed as butterflies in one's stomach.  Anyway, I get that feeling when I learn a new secret, so I might have just been excited to possibly find my super power.

In other news a man here in Honduras just killed a guy and someone called me on the radio to tell me that if I see a prowler, don't go chasing his as I might get caught in the crossfire!  Advice will be heeded!
