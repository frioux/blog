Ok, so for some reason I left out sending email from last nights' post. Here it is: sometimes people forget about RT, or they have so many RT's that they don't know which ones are fixed and broken. Well, a small nudge via email can convince them to [fix a longstanding bug](http://cpansearch.perl.org/src/DCONWAY/Perl6-Gather-0.041/Changes). Of course, if it's reasonable sending a patch wouldn't hurt either...
