I have had quite the love affair with prog-rock. One of the bands that led to
this affair was The Flower Kings. I think the third album of theirs that I got
was
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00004TXWQ/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B00004TXWQ&linkCode=as2&tag=afoolishmanif-20&linkId=715e4ecca18840bc72a0f53bd01e6d54">Space Revolver</a><img src="//ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=afoolishmanif-20&l=am2&o=1&a=B00004TXWQ" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />.
Space Revolver is very much prog and very much Flower Kings. For instance, the
first song, I Am The Sun (part one) has lots of noise and even a weird (but
awesome) sub-song that most bands certainly wouldn't do.

It has a lot of the gorgeous guitar thanks to Roine Stolt head man as well as a
lot of really amazing "soundscapes", or very instrument driven sections of
songs. I think that the soundscapes come from Tomas Bodin, who has had a few
solo albums himself.

The album also has some of the standard FloKi's Doom and Gloom in Monster
Within. To expound upon that, despite their standard message of love (see band
name,) they also have this interesting feeling of judgment in their lyrics.
Here's an example:

> So you say that you cannot sleep, you're not into counting sheep All the
> monsters are for real, something out there, the way you feel Grown up man,
> you're still losing sleep, aliens hiding in the deep Nights of terror and
> gates of hell, can't get rid of that
>
> **brimstone smell**

They have a lot of other really great albums, but you have to start somewhere
right ;-) Anyway, hopefully you will enjoy this album as much as I do.

Favorites: I Am The Sun (part one), Monster Within.

Colors: Red, Blue, Green.
