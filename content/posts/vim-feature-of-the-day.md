A coworker called me and asked me what it meant that when vim opened a file there were a bunch of **^@**'s in it. I didn't know off hand, but I **did** know that vim had some feature to print out the ascii value of the character that the cursor is over. So without further ado: [:as](http://www.vim.org/htmldoc/various.html#ga) or [ga](http://www.vim.org/htmldoc/various.html#ga)

Enjoy!
