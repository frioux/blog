Hello everyone!

Hopefully you know that today (March 9-10, starting and ending at sundown) is the holiday of [Purim!](http://net.bible.org/bible.php?book=Est&chapter=1)

I just want to mention that the best way to celebrate Purim (we did this at school) is to read the entirety of the book of Esther out loud, cheering for Mordecai (or Esther, but not both,) and booing at Haman, and each time you cheer or boo, you take a drink. At school we used non alcoholic sangria, which I think was worse than what wine or beer would have been because of all the sugar and carbonation.

Anyway, celebrate!
