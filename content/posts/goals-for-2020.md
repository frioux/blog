It's already a few days into 2020 so I'm gonna keep this brief: Goals for 2020!

<!--more-->

## 2019

The following goals are from [last year](/posts/goals-2019/).

### Learning Days

[Learning Days](/posts/goals-2019/#monthly-learning-days) were great fun the
few times I did it, but at some point last year (I know when, but you probably
don't) things kinda went off the rails.  It turns out they are a lot to plan,
so I'm gonna plan to do these quarterly, instead of monthly, in 2020.  If I
find that I have time for more, I'll do more.

### Weekly Publishing

I didn't do well with the habit of writing 200 words a day... but I published
fifty two blog posts in the year without realizing it *till today*.  I'll
call it good but will do the same thing in 2020.

### Avoid multitasking

Unlike the last one, I can't measure this quite as clearly.  I did [close
slack](/posts/distraction-free-slack/) to avoid multitasking at work, and
started [segregating long form
reading](https://twitter.com/frioux/status/1211382068539789312) from
time-wasters.  I'll call it good but something to keep doing.

### Avoid Rote Reading

I got much better at this in 2019.  I ditched stuff I was reading both by
unsubscribing and in the middle of posts.  Will continue.

### Family Journal

I did *terribly* at this and feel bad about it.  Want to try again, but need to
figure out how to do it.  Maybe not at the same time I'm doing other writing?

### Knots

I feel ok about how this went.  I could have done better, kept track of more,
etc, but it's a hobby so whatevs.

## 2020

The goals I'll be carrying forward to 2020 from 2019 are:

 * quarterly Learning Days
 * blog weekly (via 200 words per day)
 * avoid multitasking, at home and at work
 * drop tasks that are not worth doing, especially reading
 * brief, daily family journal (needs more thought put into the habit)

### Health

This year I am intending to exercize three times a week for about thirty
minutes at a time.  I had been doing two, doing the seven minute workout, but
it turns out [that it's supposed to be much more than
that](https://fogknife.com/2019-09-26-lets-rename-the-7-minute-workout-to-the-klika-jordan-workout.html),
so I'm upping this by a factor of nearly five.

On top of that I am trying to be a little more careful with my diet.  Nothing
crazy, just more greens, more fish, less red meat, etc.

### Avoid long term monotasking

This is a weird one!  While on holiday vacation I concluded that, while it's
best if I only ever work on one thing at a time, it is *not good* for me to
work on one thing at a time for days on end.  I am sure everyone needs some
amount of variety in their work, or that it's at least some kind of spectrum.

### Swap Out Habit

Once a week I get to inbox zero, tab zero, etc.  I want to try to do this more
often.  I don't think I can reasonably do this daily, but I think I can maybe
do a timeboxed version. I also want to write a quick note about anything I
learned during the day, maybe as inspiration for stuff to publish later.  On
top of all that, I tend to be sloppy with my various git checkouts and want to
do better.  I have lost time this year because I had code that was never
committed and accidentally blew it away.

We'll see how it goes.  Happy New Year!

At work I take notes for some meetings.  Sometimes that can be a frustrating
task, so in order to keep myself engaged I decided to get some nice pens and
paper.  I started with a set of <a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07H96PNS2/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B07H96PNS2&linkCode=as2&tag=afoolishmanif-20&linkId=f492d765185cce292bd608eb6f715109">Jinhao 992</a><img src="//ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=afoolishmanif-20&l=am2&o=1&a=B07H96PNS2" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />
