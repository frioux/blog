![Controlling/Creating Wind](/wp-content/uploads/2007/10/wind2.png)

Today I tried to create or control wind. No luck at all actually. I attempted say wind, making windy noises, and making various appropriate gestures. Nice try I guess?

In other news, yesterday I learned that you really should cut away from yourself. I chopped my finger pretty badly with my recently sharpened kershaw. Also: I did a presentation on Go today and I think it went well. Two people spoke to me after the presentation and one of them asked if we could play together some time. Exciting!
